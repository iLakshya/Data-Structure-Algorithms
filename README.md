# Data Structure & Algorithms
## SINGLE LINKED LIST:
- Traversing the List
- Insertion (At start of the list, end of the list and in the middle of the list)
- Deletion (From the start of the list, end of the list and middle of the list)
## DOUBLE LINKED LIST:
- Traversing the List
- Insertion (At start of the list, end of the list and in the middle of the list)
- Deletion (From the start of the list, end of the list and middle of the list)
## CIRCULAR LINKED LIST:
- Traversing the List
- Insertion (At start of the list, end of the list and in the middle of the list)
- Deletion (From the start of the list, end of the list and middle of the list)
