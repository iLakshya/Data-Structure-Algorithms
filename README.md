# Data Structure & Algorithms
## Single Linked List:
### 1. Traversing the List
### 2. Insertion (At start of the list, end of the list and in the middle of the list)
### 3. Deletion (From the start of the list, end of the list and middle of the list)
## Double Linked List:
### 1. Traversing the List
### 2. Insertion (At start of the list, end of the list and in the middle of the list)
### 3. Deletion (From the start of the list, end of the list and middle of the list)
## Circular Linked List:
### 1. Traversing the List
### 2. Insertion (At start of the list, end of the list and in the middle of the list)
### 3. Deletion (From the start of the list, end of the list and middle of the list)
